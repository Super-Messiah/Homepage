# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "In this talk, I firstly revisited the mainstream development of mechanical models and then investigated the mathematical equivalence between multiple and fractional generalizations by the means of the spectral fitting. Specifically, I constructed a mechanical model with multiple Maxwell models in parallel to approximate the fractional Zener model. Numerical results show good agreement between these two generalized models."
