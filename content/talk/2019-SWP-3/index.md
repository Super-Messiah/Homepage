# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "In this talk, I proposed a generalized stabilization scheme for seismic $Q$ compensation by incorporating a window function into the exponentially divergent time propagator. With an assumption that the exponent of the chosen window is a power function of the magnitude of wavenumber, I formulated an explicit stabilization term for the $Q$- compensated constant-$Q$ wave equation in the time-space domain."
