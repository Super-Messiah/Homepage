# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "In this talk, I firstly revisit the mainstream development of mathematical models of viscoelastic phenomenon in the context of experiments and mechanics, and then I will explore how fractional mechanical models lead to a reconciliation of these two apparently different approaches. This overview aims at providing geophysicists with more confidence when using fractional models for seismic attenuation modeling, inversion and compensation."
