Wave propagation in subsurface media typically exhibits frequency-dependent absorption and dispersion due to the presence of attenuation mechanism. Such an intrinsic attenuation property can be empirically characterized either by ex- perimentally established frequency power law or by physically based mechanical models over a wide range of frequencies. Recently, increasing papers present a variety of fractional models that have the ability to describe seismic attenuation with memory property or non-locality.
