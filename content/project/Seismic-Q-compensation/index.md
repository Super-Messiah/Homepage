When seismic waves travel through the earth subsurface, the absorption and dispersion caused by the anelasticity of the subsurface will inevitably degrade the quality of seismograms, decrease the resolution of migrated images, and eventually affect the reliability of seismic interpretation.  It is essential to compensate amplitude loss and phase distortion. In general, attenuation compensation in geophysics can be roughly classified into two categories: seismic record-based compensation and propagation-based compensation.
