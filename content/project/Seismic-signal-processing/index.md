## TOPS

The proximal splitting algorithm, which reduces complex convex optimization problems into a series of smaller subproblems and spreads the projection operator onto a convex set into the proximity operator of a convex function, has recently been introduced in the area of signal processing. Following the splitting framework, we propose a novel three-operator proximal splitting (TOPS) algorithm for 3-D seismic data reconstruction with both singular value decomposition (SVD)-based low-rank constraint and curvelet-domain sparsity constraint.
