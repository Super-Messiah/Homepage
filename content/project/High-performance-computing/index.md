summary = """The intensive computation and enormous storage requirements of wave equation-based processing, such as RTM and FWI, prevent these methods from being extended into practical application, especially for large-scale 2D or 3D case. The emerging graphics processing unit (GPU) computing technology, built around a scalable array of multithreaded Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), presents an opportunity for greatly accelerating seismic data processing by appropriately exploiting GPUâ€™s architectural characteristics.
