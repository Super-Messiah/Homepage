I am currently a Visiting Student Researcher in Geophysics at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), collaboration with Prof. [Jerry M. Harris](https://earth.stanford.edu/people/jerry-harris/). I am also a Ph.D. Candidate in Geophysics at [China University of Petroleum, Beijing](http://www.cup.edu.cn/) advised by Prof. [Hui Zhou](http://www.cup.edu.cn/cgi/szdw/js/155674.htm). 

My research interests span the areas of seismic modeling, imaging and inversion, seismic signal processing, high performance computing, and deep learning. A common thread in my research is in understanding wave propagation in attenuating media and design of the state-of-the-art algorithms and general framework to compensate the subsurface $Q$ filtering effects, so as to achieve high-fidelity seismic profiles and images. I am an advocate of Reproducible Research. I am a fan of [Leo Messi](https://messi.com/).
