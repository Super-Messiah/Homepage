# Abstract.
abstract = """
The proximal splitting algorithm, which reduces complex convex optimization problems into a series of smaller subproblems and spreads the projection operator onto a convex set into the proximity operator of a convex function, has recently been introduced in the area of signal processing. Following the splitting framework, we propose a novel three-operator proximal splitting (TOPS) algorithm for 3-D seismic data reconstruction with both singular value decomposition (SVD)-based low-rank constraint and curvelet-domain sparsity constraint. Compared with the well-known forwardâ€“backward splitting (FBS) method, our proposed TOPS algorithm can be flexibly employed to recover a signal satisfying double convex constraints simultane- ously, such as low-rank constraint and sparsity constraint used in this letter. We have used both synthetic and field data examples to demonstrate the superior performance of the TOPS method over traditional SVD-based low-rank method and curvelet-domain sparsity method based on the FBS framework."""
