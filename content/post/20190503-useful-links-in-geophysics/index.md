## Geophysicists

Here I list some personal homepage of geophysicists based on my experience and interests.

- [Jon F. Claerbout](http://sep.stanford.edu/sep/jon/) has been a leading geophysicist since the later half of the 20th Century. He pioneered the use of computers in processing and filtering seismic exploration data, eventually developing the field of time series analysis and seismic wave propagation. He is the founder of the [Stanford Exploration Project (SEP)](http://sep.stanford.edu/doku.php), the first geophysical research consortium funded by the oil and gas industry. He was one of the first scientists to emphasize that computational methods threaten the reproducibility of research unless open access is provided to both the data and the software underlying a publication. He developed [SEPlib](http://sep.stanford.edu/doku.php?id=sep:software:seplib), a complete and freely distributed seismic data processing software package.
