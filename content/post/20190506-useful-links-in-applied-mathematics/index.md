## Applied mathematicians

- [Wotao Yin](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~wotaoyin/index.html) develops open-source algorithms at [UCLA Optimization Group](https://github.com/uclaopt). He also contributes his work at [Rice University, L1-Related Optimization Project](https://www.caam.rice.edu/~optimization/L1/).

- [Yifei Lou](https://sites.google.com/site/louyifei)

- [Emmanuel Candes](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/index.html) contributes to [CurveLab](http://www.curvelet.org/index.html).

- [Stephen P. Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/) developed is a Matlab-based modeling system [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) for convex optimization.

- [SPGL1](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mpf/spgl1/index.html) is a Matlab solver for large-scale one-norm regularized least squares.

- [Dave Donoho](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/statistics/cgi-bin/donoho/) contributes to [SparseLab](http://sparselab.stanford.edu/), [WaveLab](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/).

- [Stephen J. Wright](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/) contributes to [GPSR](http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf/GPSR/). He develops open-source algorithms at [Stanford University Convex Optimization Group](https://github.com/cvxgrp/).
