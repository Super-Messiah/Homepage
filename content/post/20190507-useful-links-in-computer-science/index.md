## Website resources


- [Deep Learning](http://deeplearning.net/) is intended to host a variety of resources and pointers to information about Deep Learning.

- [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) provides a series of courses about machine learning and deep learning. The Machine Learning course and Deep Learning Specialization teach the most important and foundational principles of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. TensorFlow Specialization teaches you how to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that you can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems. 

- [Deeplearning.ai Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w/featured) provides the videos from Deep Learning specialization on Coursera. 

- [Seedbank](https://research.google.com/seedbank/) is a Collection of Interactive Machine Learning Examples.


- [Stanford Vision Lab](http://vision.stanford.edu/index.html)

- [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)


- [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) is a community that offers tutorials and Ebooks to help developers get started and get good at applied machine learning.


- [The Deep Learning textbook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) is a resource intended to help students and practitioners enter the field of machine learning in general and deep learning in particular. The online version of the book is now complete and will remain available online for free.
